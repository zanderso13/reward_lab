File /projects/p30954/reward_lab/gift_out_spatial/RiDE_postprocess_results.mat contains spectra and FNC correlations
spectra_tc_all - Timecourses spectra. spectra_tc_all variable is of dimensions subjects x sessions x spectral length x components
fnc_corrs_all - FNC correlations transformed to fisher z-scores. fnc_corrs_all variable is of dimensions subjects x sessions x components x components
